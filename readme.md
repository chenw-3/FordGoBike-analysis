# Ford GO Bike Analysis
## by Chennel Williams


## Ford GO Bike Share Service

> The dataset was rpovided by Udacity and includes information about users of the Ford GO Bike share service in the city of San Franciso. It encompasses the user's start location, end location, trip duration time, gender, whether they subscribed to the service or not, whether they used the service for their entire trip as well as their birth year. 
> I used Stackoverflow, Matplotlib and Seaborn documentations, Python for Data Scinece for Dummies, as well as freeCodeCamp to assist in completion of this project.


## Summary of Findings

> My goal was to develop an idea of what the average user was like and create a profile. Based on my analysis, the average user of the bike share service is a 33 year old male subscriber who did not use the service for the entirey of his trips. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Some key insights I got were: 
1) Females had longer trip times, even though they only made up 29% of the user base. Females had longer trip times than males with the median female trip time being approximately 575 seconds. The median male trip time is approximately 500 seconds. So, even though there are more males who use the bike share service, they use it for shorter time periods than the females who use the service. 

2) There were more young people than old people, which could have been due to the obvious fitness limitations on older humans. This also showed up when looking at the number of users that used the service for their entire trip. Older users used the service for their entir trips, which were much shorter than their younger counterparts, while younger users frequently had longer trip times and opted for other modes of transportation.
